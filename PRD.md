## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the full product scope for a proprietary **Human Resource Management System (HRMS)** for the company. The system is designed to consolidate all HR operations — from hiring to exit — into a single, modular, web-based platform.

Key differentiators from off-the-shelf solutions:
- **Modular architecture** — every feature is an independent module; new features can be added without touching existing ones.
- **Hikvision face-recognition integration** — automated attendance sync from the physical entry/exit machine.
- **Project-aware HRMS** — built-in project management with PBAC and auto performance evaluation based on task completion rates.
- **Auto-communication engine** — triggered emails for onboarding, shortlisting, birthdays, leave, and project events.

## 5. UI/UX Design Guidelines

### 5.1 Design Language

- **Style:** Modern SaaS — clean, minimal, data-forward
- **Color Palette:**
  - Primary: `#2563EB` (Blue 600) — actions, CTAs
  - Secondary: `#7C3AED` (Violet 600) — accents
  - Success: `#16A34A` (Green 600)
  - Warning: `#D97706` (Amber 600)
  - Danger: `#DC2626` (Red 600)
  - Background: `#F8FAFC` (Slate 50)
  - Surface: `#FFFFFF`
  - Text Primary: `#0F172A` (Slate 900)
  - Text Secondary: `#64748B` (Slate 500)
  - Border: `#E2E8F0` (Slate 200)

- **Typography:** Inter (headings) + Inter (body) — system-ui fallback
- **Radius:** 8px cards, 6px buttons, 4px inputs
- **Shadows:** Subtle (1–2px elevation only)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (consistent, outlined)

### 5.2 Layout

- **Sidebar navigation** (collapsible, 240px expanded / 64px icon-only)
- **Top bar:** search, notification bell, user avatar
- **Main content:** max-width container with responsive grid
- **Breadcrumbs** on all inner pages

Sidebar structure:
```
🏠 Dashboard
👥 Employees
   ├── Directory
   └── Org Chart
📋 Recruitment
⏱ Attendance
🗓 Leave
💰 Payroll
📊 Performance
📁 Documents
🚀 Projects
   └── My Tasks
📧 Notifications
📈 Reports
⚙️  Admin (PBAC, Settings)
```

### 5.3 Key UX Patterns

- **Empty states:** illustrated, with a clear CTA (not just "No data")
- **Loading skeletons:** never spinners on full-page loads
- **Optimistic UI:** actions feel instant, errors roll back
- **Inline editing:** click a field to edit in-place where applicable
- **Bulk actions:** checkbox select + action bar (for employee lists, task lists)
- **Confirmation dialogs:** for destructive actions only
- **Toast notifications:** non-blocking, top-right, 3-second auto-dismiss
- **Responsive:** tablet-friendly minimum; mobile for employee self-service
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** documented, accessible

### 5.4 Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- All interactive elements focusable and keyboard navigable
- Color is never the sole indicator of state
- Screen reader labels on all form fields

## 6. Tech Stack Recommendation

Single Next.js 14 monorepo — frontend pages and backend API routes live together. No separate backend server.

### Framework & Language
| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Framework | **Next.js 14 (App Router)** | Unified frontend + API in one project; Route Handlers replace a standalone server |
| Language | TypeScript | End-to-end type safety across pages and API routes |
| Runtime | Node.js 20 | Next.js API routes run as standard Node.js; no extra runtime needed |

### Frontend (UI layer — `/app/(dashboard)/`)
| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| UI Components | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS | Accessible, themeable, copy-paste component library |
| State — server | TanStack Query (React Query v5) | Data fetching, caching, background refetch against `/api/` routes |
| State — client | Zustand | Lightweight global UI state (sidebar, modals, user session) |
| Charts | Recharts | React-native, composable charts |
| Tables | TanStack Table v8 | Headless, virtual scroll, server-side pagination |
| Rich Text Editor | Tiptap | Email template builder in M10 |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Performant, schema-validated forms |
| PDF Viewer | react-pdf | View uploaded PDFs in-browser |
| Date utilities | date-fns | Lightweight date formatting and arithmetic |

### Backend (API layer — `/app/api/`)
| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| API style | Next.js Route Handlers (`route.ts`) | Built into Next.js; no separate server process |
| PBAC middleware | Next.js `middleware.ts` | Runs on Edge before every `/api/*` request; validates JWT + checks permission scope |
| Auth | **next-auth v5 (Auth.js)** | Session management, JWT, OAuth (Google/Microsoft SSO), MFA support |
| ORM | **Prisma** | Type-safe DB client, schema-first migrations, works perfectly in Next.js API routes |
| Job Queue | **BullMQ** (Redis-backed) | Email jobs, scheduled crons (attendance sync, birthday emails); runs as a separate worker process (`worker.ts`) |
| File Storage | **MinIO** (self-hosted S3-compatible) | Document/payslip/resume storage; signed URLs for secure download |
| Email | Nodemailer + SendGrid | Nodemailer for SMTP; SendGrid as fallback via API |
| PDF Generation | Puppeteer (headless) | Server-side payslip, offer letter, report PDF generation in API routes |
| Validation | Zod | Shared schema validation used in both forms and API route request bodies |
| HTTP client | Axios | Internal calls to Hikvision ISAPI from API routes |

### Database
| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Primary DB | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Cache + Queue store | Redis 7 (also used by BullMQ) |
| Full-text search | PostgreSQL `tsvector` to start; migrate to Meilisearch if needed |
| File storage | MinIO (S3-compatible, self-hosted) |

### DevOps
| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose (Next.js app + worker + PostgreSQL + Redis + MinIO) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Hosting | Hetzner VPS / AWS EC2 (self-hosted) |
| Reverse Proxy | Nginx (SSL termination + static asset caching) |
| SSL | Let's Encrypt (Certbot) |
| Monitoring | Grafana + Prometheus |
| Logs | Loki (or PM2 logs) |
| Backups | Daily `pg_dump` → MinIO bucket with 30-day retention |

### Key architectural notes

- **No separate backend server.** Everything runs inside Next.js. The `/app/api/` Route Handlers ARE the backend.
- **BullMQ worker** is the only separate process — it runs as `node worker.ts` alongside Next.js to process email jobs and cron tasks (Hikvision sync, birthday mailer, etc.) without blocking API responses.
- **Prisma client** is instantiated as a singleton in `lib/db.ts` and imported directly into Route Handlers.
- **PBAC** is enforced in `middleware.ts` (Edge runtime) for route-level guards, with fine-grained permission checks inside each Route Handler using `lib/auth.ts` helpers.
- **Shared Zod schemas** live in `lib/schemas/` and are imported by both the form layer and API route handlers — single source of truth for validation.

## 7. Integration Specifications

### 7.1 Hikvision Device Integration

**Device:** Hikvision DS-K Series Face Recognition Terminal

**Method 1: ISAPI HTTP Pull (Recommended)**

```
Backend Cron (every 15 min):
  GET http://<device_ip>/ISAPI/AccessControl/AcsEvent?format=json
  Headers: Authorization: Digest <credentials>
  
Response: array of events
  {
    "employeeNoString": "EMP-2024-0042",
    "time": "2026-04-06T09:04:22",
    "eventType": "entry", // or "exit"
    "deviceName": "Main Gate"
  }

Backend maps employeeNoString → employee_id
Inserts into attendance_logs table
Deduplicates by (employee_id, timestamp)
```

**Method 2: CSV Import Parser**

Supported columns from Hikvision export:
- `Card No` or `Employee No`
- `Date Time`
- `Event Description` (Entry / Exit)

Mapping rules:
- Employee No → matched against `employees.device_id` field
- First event of day = IN, last event = OUT
- Intermediate events discarded

### 7.2 Email Service (SMTP / SendGrid)

- Configure SMTP credentials in Admin Settings
- Fallback: SendGrid API if SMTP fails
- All outbound emails BCC to `hr-archive@company.com` (configurable)

### 7.3 Calendar Integration (Optional)

- Google Calendar API: create interview events, auto-send invites
- Outlook/Exchange: CalDAV sync

### 7.4 E-Sign Integration (Optional)

- DocuSign API or DigiLocker API for Indian compliance
- Alternatively: native canvas-based signature capture
