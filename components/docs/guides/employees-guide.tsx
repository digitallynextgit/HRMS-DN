      <GuideSection title="Employee Directory">
        <p>Go to <strong>Sidebar → Employees → Employee List</strong>.</p>
        <p>
          This shows all employees in the company. Use the search bar at the top to find someone by name. You can also filter the list by department or by status (Active, Resigned, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Click on any employee&apos;s name to open their full profile, where you can see their contact details, employment info, documents, and attendance summary.

            "Click the Add Employee button in the top-right corner of the Employee List page.",
            "Fill in the personal details: full name, email address, phone number, and date of birth.",

          Once you save the new employee, the system automatically sends them a welcome email with their login details. They can log into HRMS right away.

      <GuideSection title="Editing an Employee">
        <p>
          Click on the employee&apos;s name to open their profile. Then click the <strong>Edit</strong> button at the top right.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can update any of their details — personal info, employment details, contact information, and more. Click Save when you are done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every change you make is recorded in the system&apos;s audit log, so there is always a record of what was changed and when.

      <GuideSection title="Deactivating an Employee">
        <p>
          When someone leaves the company — whether they resign or are terminated — you need to deactivate their account so they can no longer access HRMS.

      <GuideSection title="Org Chart">
        <p>Go to <strong>Sidebar → Employees → Org Chart</strong>.</p>
        <p>
          The org chart shows the full reporting hierarchy of the company in a visual tree. You can see who reports to whom at every level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click on any person&apos;s card to go directly to their employee profile. Use the arrow buttons on a card to expand or collapse the branches below that person.

        Always assign a Manager when creating a new employee. The manager assignment is required for leave approvals to work — without it, leave requests will not be routed to anyone.
