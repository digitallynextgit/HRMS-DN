          The sidebar on the left is how you move around the app. Here is what each section does:

        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground text-xs">
          You only see the sections your role gives you access to. If something is missing, check with your HR team.
        </p>
      </GuideSection>

      <GuideSection title="Your Profile">
        <p>
          To see your own details, click your name or avatar in the top-right corner of the screen, then choose <strong>View Profile</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your profile shows your employment information — department, designation, manager, joining date, and contact details. If anything looks wrong, ask HR to update it for you.
        </p>
      </GuideSection>

      <GuideSection title="Notifications">
        <p>
          The bell icon at the top of the screen shows a number when you have unread messages. Click it to see a preview, or go to <strong>Notifications</strong> in the sidebar to read everything in full.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will get notifications when your leave is approved or rejected, when your payslip is ready, or when HR sends you a message.
        </p>
      </GuideSection>

      <TipBox variant="tip">
        If you cannot see a menu item, your role may not have access to that section. Contact your HR team and they can check your permissions.
